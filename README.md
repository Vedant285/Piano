Clone or download the project, start it under a server environment, open index.html. That is to say, don't open it as "file://", because it won't work that way.

**Instructions:**

1. **Keyboard Layout**: The keys A, S, D, F, J, K, L, and ; are mapped to the musical notes A3, B3, C3, D3, E3, F3, G3, and A4 respectively. This layout is chosen to align with the natural hand position of a typist on a QWERTY keyboard.

2. **Playing Notes**: Pressing each key will produce the corresponding piano note. For example:
   - Press **A** for the note **A3** (La3).
   - Press **S** for the note **B3** (Si3).

**Visual Feedback**: Upon pressing a key, the corresponding virtual piano key will be displayed as being pressed and released on the screen.
